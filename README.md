To design an algorithm that determines whether an individual is *wearing a face mask*, *not wearing a face mask*, or *wearing a face mask incorrectly*.

## Dataset
We combined 2 different datasets together to form a three class classification. With over 17,000 images and additional images for people of color and people who are white

## Results
`KNN`
The optimal parameters resulted in 86.7% accuracy, and performed lower when dimensionality reduction techniques were included.

`Decision Tree`
The optimal parameters resulted in 84% accuracy, and performed lower when dimensionality reduction techniques were included.

`SVM`
Reached an accuracy of ~93% with our testing dataset.

`Naive Bayes`
Because of naive bayes assumption and how much pixels correlate with each other, it performed with ~68% for multinomial and ~77% for Gaussian.

`CNN`
Best performing: Reached an accuracy of ~98% with our testing data. 


## Conclusion
In conclusion our best performing model was CNN, achieving 98% testing accuracy. Our classifers that were comparable to our baseline paper underperformed, within a margin of 6-~15%. In regards to our POC and W datasets, all classifiers underperformed dramatically, with an emphasis on lower accuracies for the W dataset.
